          'The model-code gap\n\nWhen we’re having an architecture discussion, we’ll talk about abstractions, using terms like component, module and layer. These abstractions reflect our mental model of a software system, which are useful when describing our architectural ideas and intent. These same abstractions don’t typically exist in the programming languages we use though. There’s no layer keyword in Java, for example. To implement these abstractions, we need to use a combination of the constructs available in our programming languages; such as classes, interfaces, objects, functions, packages, namespaces, files and folders. In many cases, the code that is written doesn’t end up reflecting the model. This is the model-code gap.\nThe model - code gap manifests itself in a number of ways. In obvious cases, the code doesn’t match the architecture diagrams.Sometimes the problems are more subtle though. This session is about the model-code gap, and particularly how it relates to applications that are built from a single monolithic deployment unit.Regardless of how we choose to structure our code(layers, vertical slices, ports and adapters, etc), our best design intentions can be destroyed in a flash if we don’t consider the intricacies of the implementation strategy. The devil is in the implementation details.\n\n\nVisualising software architecture\n\nIt’s very likely that the majority of the software architecture diagrams you’ve seen are a confused mess of boxes and lines. Following the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, teams have abandoned UML, discarded the concept of modelling and instead place a heavy reliance on conversations centered around incoherent whiteboard diagrams or shallow “Marketecture” diagrams created with Visio. Moving fast and being agile requires good communication, yet software development teams struggle with this fun- damental skill. A good set of software architecture diagrams are priceless for aligning a team around a shared vision and for getting new-joiners productive fast.\nThis session explores the visual communication of software architecture and is based upon a decade of my experiences working with software development teams large and small across the globe. We’ll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, and the value of creating a lightweight model to describe your software system using the ”C4 model”, which I created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up - front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.'

The methodical five days approach, forces the team to explore a vast space of ideas, and assist you in quickly narrowing them down to the one you really want to test on your users. An agile approach to the design phase, that allows your team to fail fast and shortcuts the idea→learning feedback loop. Do you think we could be more curious and creative in the earlier stages of our projects. Do you think that our projects are agile in name, but not always in practice. Or have you at some point simply experienced that the code you were writing, was an excellent answer, but sadly for the wrong question. Then join in for three hours of fun, a new perspective on the design phase, and a pocket full of ideation activities and practices for you and your team.\nPrimarily for: Everyone\nParticipant requirements: Their head and hands.'

          'The vision/purpose for Omnia Radix is Happy and efficient Software Developers. We want to provide a basic modern cloud native software engineering capability for small teams. Keywords are iterative development, automation CI/CD and monitoring.\n\nIn this workshop we will build a simple web app using a basic software devel- opment workflow (code, version control, build, test), move the app to Docker containers and eventually deploy the app to the Radix platform.\n\nThe Radix platform that we will use is very early alpha stage - so expect some manual hurdles. When finished you should have an idea about how a cloud native software development workflow could look like - and what role Radix could play for your team.\n\nIn the workshop, you can use any programming language that you want to as long as it’s able to run in a Docker container on a Linux architecture. Our example app will be written in Node.JS. If you prefer to follow this “track” - please make sure that Node.JS is\n\nWho is this workshop for?\n\nSoftware developers & Coding Data Scientists. You have at least one ecosystem that you know quite good. You know git. You have some knowledge of Web development (http) You have played around with Docker. You are searching for a good way to deploy your applications and webservices. You want to get started - or continue with - CI/CD, and want this to be as easy as possible. You have at least one cool sticker on your laptop!\n\nPre-requisites\nYour own precious developer laptop with the following installed and working\n• Development ecosystem of your choice (Node, Python, C#...). The examples in the workshop will be using node.js.\n• Docker installed and working\n• Having a active account on github.com and a working ssh regime with github.com\n• Git installed and working locally\n• ssh-keygen installed and working\n• If you are using an Equinor laptop - make sure you know how to manage proxy settings\n\nThe full script of the workshop is available on https://github.com/larskaare/edcradix/blob/master/docs/radixintro.md\n\nHead over to equinor.slack.com and join the channel #omnia_radix_edc2019 for in-workshop communication'
